# Hi!

My name is Jakub Koz≈Çowski. I'm a software engineer, currently working at [Disney Streaming Services](https://www.disneystreaming.com/).

I'm mostly interested in Scala and functional programming. Sometimes I make videos, which [you can find on YouTube](http://yt.kubukoz.com).

If you want to talk about FP, hit me up on Twitter [@kubukoz](https://twitter.com/kubukoz) or send me an email, I'll be more than happy to help if I can.

## Current projects

This is where I should be the most active in public contributions.

### Actively working on

- [spotify-next](https://github.com/kubukoz/spotify-next): support for frontend clients
- [my Nix config](https://github.com/kubukoz/nix-config): migrating packages from brew, hopefully adding them to nixpkgs upstream

### OSS plans

- toy language with integrated tooling: vscode syntax / LSP server, compiled to JVM bytecode / llvm / x86

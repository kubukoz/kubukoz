Hi!

My name is Jakub Koz≈Çowski. I'm a software engineer, currently working at [Ocado Technology](https://ocadotechnology.com/).

I'm mostly interested in Scala and functional programming. Sometimes I make videos, which [you can find on YouTube](http://yt.kubukoz.com).

If you want to talk about FP, hit me up on Twitter [@kubukoz](https://twitter.com/kubukoz) or send me an email, I'll be more than happy to help if I can.
